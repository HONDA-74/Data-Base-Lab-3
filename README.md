This repository contains all the **documentation and visual materials** for **Database Lab 3** as part of the ITI 9-Month Program.

## 📌 Description  
In Lab 3, we focused on designing and implementing advanced database concepts. This repo includes:  
- 📄 PDF files (lab exercise sheets, design documents, and theoretical notes)  
- 🖼️ Images (ER diagrams, relational schema graphics, screenshots of SQL output or design sketches)

This repository does **not** include executable code — it is purely for documentation and design.
